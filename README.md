# News-Net
News Net is built using the MVVM architecture. It uses RecyclerView to display the list of news articles in an resource efficient manner. The user can read and save the article in the local database with the help of WebView and RoomDB respectively. This app also implements Pagination. Fully coded in Kotlin which provides the feature of Coroutines to handle long-running tasks. To fetch the data it uses Retrofit library. Used Android Jetpack's Navigation Component to achieve the navigation between the screens.
